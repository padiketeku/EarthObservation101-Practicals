# Activity 10: Classification of Surface Types

Usually, there are many surface types within a remotely sensed imagery: water, vegetation, baresoil, built-up areas, roadss, etc. Despitee the varied surface types, users may not be be interested in all of these surface types. In fact, a map user would be more interested in just one surface type and would like to know where in the image this surface type is located. Because of this making a thematic map out of the imagery would be more helpful for the user. In this activity thematic map was created using image classification methods, including minimum distance and k-nearest neighbour.
