# Activity 10: Classification of Surface Types

Usually, there are many surface types within a remotely sensed imagery: water, vegetation, baresoil, built-up areas, roadss, etc. Despitee the varied surface types, users may not be be interested in all of these surface types. In fact, a map user would be more interested in just one surface type and would like to know where in the image this surface type is located. Because of this, making a thematic map out of the imagery would be more helpful for the user. In this activity thematic map was created using image classification methods, including k-means clustering and minimum distance. The activity assumes you have covered the activities preceding this one, especially activities 7 and 8.

## Introduction
Image classification is collecting similar pixels into a group or theme. For instance, grouping all water pixels under a theme. The pixels are grouped according to their spectral similarity and taking into account spectral distance between pixels. The pixel grouping can be done by the computer or the analyst teaching the computer to do this. If the classification of pixels is predominantly performed by the computer this is described as **unsupervised** while where the analyst teaches the computer to perform the classification is referred to as **supervised**. The activity explores k-mean clustering and minimum distance to explain unsupervised and supervised classifiers, respectively.


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this activity, you should be able to: <br>

- collect point features
- perform k-means clustering (unsupervised classification)
- perform minimum distance classification (supervised technique)
- visualisation classification map
- export the classification map to google drive
