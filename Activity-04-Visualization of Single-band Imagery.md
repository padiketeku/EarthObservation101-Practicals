# Activity 4: Visualization of Single-band Imagery

## Introduction
Light, mainly from the sun, is used by remote sensing detectors, including the human eye, to create pictures of the environment. In Remote Sensing, light, which is electromagnetic radiation, is described using a range of wavelengths referred to as a band. Solar radiation and the cone and rod cells of the human eye make objects in our environment visible to us. The human eye has blue, green, and red cone cells making us see objects around us as red, green, blue (RGB), or a mixture of the RGB in a good lighting condition. At night or in a low-lighting environment, the rod cells are more active, and thus, we see objects in shades of black and white (i.e., greyscale).
