# Activity 4: Visualization of Single-band Imagery

## Introduction
Light, mainly from the sun, is used by remote sensing detectors, including the human eye, to create pictures of the environment. In Remote Sensing, light, which is electromagnetic radiation, is described using a range of wavelengths referred to as a band. Solar radiation and the cone and rod cells of the human eye make objects in our environment visible to us. The human eye has blue, green, and red cone cells making us see objects around us as red, green, blue (RGB), or a mixture of the RGB in a good lighting condition. At night or in a low-lighting environment, the rod cells are more active, and thus, we see objects in shades of black and white (i.e., greyscale).

| *The human eye as a natural remote sensing detector through the cone and rod cells of the retina. The blue cone cell, green cone cells, and red cone cells give humans colour vision. The rod cells are only turned on at night or in a poor lighting environment to visualise objects in a black-white range.*|

A mechanical remote sensing detector replicates human vision in that solar radiation with a wavelength ranging between 400-700 nm is employed for humans to capture objects in RGB and/or a mixture of the RGB.

## Learning Outcomes
- Create a new script file
- Search through the Earth Engine repository for data
- Load an image into the Code Editor
- Visualisation of images
- Use the Inspector tool to understand data
- Differentiate between pseudo-colour image, true colour image, and false colour image 

### Create a new script file
To start a new script, click the `Scripts` tab, **NEW** (the drop-down triangle), and select **File**. Fig. 1 shows the steps.

A `Create file' window pops up for you to specify the file name. In this example, the file name is prac1002. Make sure new script files are saved to the same repository. Once the file is created you would see it (highlighted in grey) under the repository, as shown below (Fig. 2).
