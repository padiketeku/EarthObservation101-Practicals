# Activity 9: Describing the Temperature of Surface Types

In this practical, you will explore MODIS land surface temperature (LST) to understand temperature of surface types. Also, you will explore the relationship between temperature and vegetation by plotting MODIS NDVI against MODIS LST. The MODIS NDVI will be derived from the surface reflectance product.
Assumes knowledge of previous actvities and that you can create spectral indices, including NDVI.

## Introduction
Temperature is an environmental parameter useful for the monitoring of the biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and lithosphere. In-field measurement of temperature can be expensive and time-consuming, while thermal remote sensing provides a more cost-efficient method for a rapid collection of temperature data. Passive remote sensing systems utilising visible, near-infrared, and microwave sensors record reflected energy. In contrast, thermal sensors detect the temperature of materials by recording the emitted energy. The energy emitted is a product of the incident radiation the materials absorbed. Ideally, the more energy the materials absorb (hotter materials) the more energy they are able to emit.
