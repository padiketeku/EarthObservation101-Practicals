# Activity 1: Google Earth Pro

## Introduction

Google Earth Pro (GEP) is a free desktop software that enables the viewing of a large set of remotely sensed imagery and other spatial data that has been made freely available. GEP has recent and historical imagery of the landscapes globally, making it a great spatial database. The GEP images can be multisource, combining low and high-resolution data to achieve wall-to-wall coverage. High-resolution images are typically available for urban locations with large populations. The GEP has functionalities and tools for importing and exploring vector data (including waypoints, tracks, and routes from a global positioning system unit) and raster data, as well as creating attribute tables. GEP allows users to connect their GPS unit for real-time visualisation or the collection of spatial data. With GEP, users can add features such as placemarks, paths, and polygons. These capabilities make GEP an important resource for environmental and geospatial scientists. GEP provides a quick reference to visualise an area of interest, allowing for an overview of the landscape features. GEP is particularly valuable during the planning stages of projects requiring fieldwork and for collecting reference data to calibrate and validate land cover maps. Additionally, GEP offers users the opportunity to explore historical imagery of the landscape, enabling easy observation of environmental changes. Despite the benefits GEP offers, its images are for only visualisation; users cannot download them for analysis. Moreover, GEP lacks an environment for processing and analysing spatial data. Users must resort to other geospatial software, such as Google Earth Engine and ENVI, for the quantitative application of the spatial data.



## Learning Outcomes


At the end of this activity you should be able to:
- Download and install Google Earth Pro if you do not have this already
- Google Earth’s 3D viewing system
- Change image coordinates



## Activity

1. Open your web browser and go to https://www.google.com/earth/versions/. <br>

Scroll to the bottom of this page and click “Download Earth Pro on Desktop” (see the figure below for a guide), and install the latest version of Google Earth Pro on your computer.

The software is easy to use with rapid and intuitive navigation. Explore its functionality by navigating to different locations of the Earth, zooming in and out and changing the aspect. Add some different spatial data layers and experiment with the tools.


Take particular note of the following features:

Google Earth’s 3D viewing system
This is an unprojected viewing system which mimics what you would see if you were actually in air or space above the ground yourself. At a very small scale when you can see the whole Earth, for example, the curvature of the Earth is clear. At larger scales, when you are zoomed into an area with some significant topographical features (hills or mountains), the terrain clearly exhibits a 3D effect, especially if you move the image around with the mouse.

A flat map, on the other hand, usually uses a projected viewing system that flattens out the curvature of the Earth. This leads to spatial distortion; the smaller the scale of the map, the larger the level of distortion. Flat maps will use contour lines to represent topography.


Change image coordinates
The image coordinates are at the foot of the Google Earth application window. For unprojected imagery, it is best to use geographic coordinates, i.e., longitude and latitude. From the menu, select Tools -> Options... In the 3D View tab there is an option box that allows you to switch between coordinate systems. We will be using Decimal Degrees. You can change to Minutes and Seconds or Decimal Minutes options; these are similar to Decimal Degrees, but which split each degree up into 60 minute intervals, and, in the case of the Minutes and Seconds option, further split each minute into 60 seconds. You may still see coordinates given in these systems, but the decimal degrees system is becoming the standard.
