# Activity 1: Google Earth Pro

## Introduction

Google Earth Pro (GEP) is a free desktop software that enables the viewing of a large set of remotely sensed imagery and other spatial data that has been made freely available. GEP has recent and historical imagery of the landscapes globally, making it a great spatial database. The GEP images can be multisource, combining low and high-resolution data to achieve wall-to-wall coverage. High-resolution images are typically available for urban locations with large populations. The GEP has functionalities and tools for importing and exploring vector data (including waypoints, tracks, and routes from a global positioning system unit) and raster data, as well as creating attribute tables. GEP allows users to connect their GPS unit for real-time visualisation or the collection of spatial data. With GEP, users can add features such as placemarks, paths, and polygons. These capabilities make GEP an important resource for environmental and geospatial scientists. GEP provides a quick reference to visualise an area of interest, allowing for an overview of the landscape features. GEP is particularly valuable during the planning stages of projects requiring fieldwork and for collecting reference data to calibrate and validate land cover maps. Additionally, GEP offers users the opportunity to explore historical imagery of the landscape, enabling easy observation of environmental changes. Despite the benefits GEP offers, its images are for only visualisation; users cannot download them for analysis. Moreover, GEP lacks an environment for processing and analysing spatial data. Users must resort to other geospatial software, such as Google Earth Engine and ENVI, for the quantitative application of the spatial data.
