# Activity 11: Working with LiDAR Data



## Introduction

LiDAR is an acronym for light detection and ranging, pulses of light (usually NIR) are sent down to the target and the intensity and distance (range) of the return pulse are recorded. The pulses occur as point clouds that provide a 3D structure of the target. The lidar returns can be extracted to provide the characteristics of the terrain, surface materials, and thus height of vertical objects. In this practical, you will work through lidar data products with the aim of evaluating the elevation of Australia and determining the height of vertical objects using data from England.
