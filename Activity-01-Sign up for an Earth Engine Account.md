# Activity 1: Sign up for an Earth Engine Account

## What is Google Earth Engine
Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for scientific spatial and non-spatial data analysis. It provides ready-to-use, cloud-hosted datasets and a large pool of servers. 
One feature that makes Earth Engine particularly attractive is the ability to run large computations very fast by distributing them across a large pool of servers.
The ability to efficiently use cloud-hosted datasets and computation is enabled by the Earth Engine API. An API is a way to communicate with Earth Engine servers. 
It allows you to specify what computation you would like to do and then to receive the results. The API is designed so that users do not need to worry about how 
the computation is distributed across a cluster of machines, and the results are assembled. Users of the API simply specify what needs to be done. 
This greatly simplifies the code by hiding the implementation detail from the users. It also makes Earth Engine very approachable for users who are not familiar with writing code.
Earth Engine API is designed to be language agnostic. Google provides official client libraries to use the API from both JavaScript and Python. 
The API remains largely the same regardless of the programming language you use. The main difference is the syntax used to call the API functions. 
Once you learn the syntax for programming languages, your code can be adapted easily because they all use the same API functions.



## Learning Outcome

- Sign up for an Earth Engine account, if you do not already have this.



## Assumptions

- Participants already have a GMAIL aacount.

- Participants have acces to stable internet.

- This is participants first attaempt at creating a GEE account.



## Get Earth Engine Account
The Google Earth Engine can be used by both non-commercial and commercial users once they sign up for an account. 
This section provides a step-by-step guide to creating an account for non-commercial users only. The Earth Engine User Guide contains detailed instructions for creating an Earth Engine account.  Review the instructions [<u>**here**</u>](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/access) and follow the below instructions 
to create a non-commercial user account. The non-commercial user account is free of charge for non-commercial use and research projects. 
The non-commercial users include non-profit organisations, educators, academic institutions, and government researchers. 

1, Use this [link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) to sign up for Earth Engine using the Google Cloud. You may have to choose or sign in to your GMAIL account for the link to bring up a window with details shown in the figure below.

3, When done filling out the form, click **Next** <br>

Another window for the registration process pops up, complete this as shown below. Keep the Project-ID to default, this may not be the same as you see in the below figure.
You can specify the **Project Name** to your choice but for the sake of this tutorial keep this same as shown below. <br>

After the confirmation (please exercise patience if the confirmation is taking long complete), you may see the **Code Editor** (a pane for writing code) as shown below. <br>






![Fig-5-GettingStartedUsingGEE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb366e4-8494-4e65-8cab-453fe14e83e9)  <br>







This means that your registration is successful and you can now start exploring the Code Editor. <br>
