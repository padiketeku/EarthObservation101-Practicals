# Activity 3: Understanding Data Types and Conventions

## Introduction
JavaScript is the main programming language underlying the Earth Engine. JavaScript is implemented in Earth Engine through client-side and server-side objects. The server-side processing is strongly recommended for your analysis. If you are new to JavaScript, knowing the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, comments, data types, and writing user-defined functions or understanding functions, is invaluable. This activity aims to explain the basics of JavaScript while writing simple codes in the Code Editor. 

## Learning Outcomes
- Familiarity with the Earth Engine Code Editor
- Familiarity with the JavaScript syntax
- Ability to use the Earth Engine API functions from the Code Editor

### Variables
In computer programming, a variable is used to store data values. In JavaScript, you define a variable declaring the `var` keyword and follow it up with the name of the variable, as shown below.
```JavaScript
var age = 55;
```
The above code is a variable (because of the **var**), the name of the variable is age, and 55 is assigned to the variable. The semicolon marks the end of the statement (think of the semicolon as a full stop for every English sentence you write). Although it is a good practice to end every variable statement with a semicolon, the code editor runs well even if this is missing.
