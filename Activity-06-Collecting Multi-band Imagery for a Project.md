# Actvity 6: Collecting Multi-band Imagery for a Project

## Introduction

In the previous chapter, we worked through single-band and multi-band imagery through a method that allows us to load our own (external) image into the Code Editor. In many real-life cases, you might be required to use data existing within the Earth Engine repository. The Earth Engine data catalogue contains many multi-band imagery collected using popular satellite sensors, including Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS. While some imagery requires pre-analysis post-processing, others are ready for analysis. 
The satellite sensors would usually take a photo of the target at regular intervals, e.g., every six days. The repeat measurement of the target by the satellite means that a stack of images becomes available for a scene. Depending upon the satelliteâ€™s repeat time and length of time in operation, the volume of data can be greatly large. Although you might not need all of the data, including the entire scene, for a project, you may need to filter the catalogue to be sure you are using the data that meets your requirements. The chapter aims to show how to search data, filter data collection, and explore a stack of images.
The activity assumes you are able to produce true colour composite and false colour composite images.


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the session, you should be able to:

- Explain image collection
- Define a region of interest 
- Filter image collection
- Visualise image collection
