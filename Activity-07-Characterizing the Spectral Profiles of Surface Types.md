# Activity 7: Characterizing the Spectral Profiles of Surface Types


## Introduction

A spectral response curve is plotting the amount of return energy recorded by the sensor for each waveband of the remote sensing device for a target of interest. A waveband is plotted against reflectance in a two-dimensional plot. Ideally, the curve shows a unique profile of the target, which might be used to discriminate the target from other targets in the image. The curve is usually characterised by peaks and troughs with the peaks representing reflectance. The troughs would be low reflectance, but high absorption of energy by the target. A single image is required to produce a spectral reflectance curve. Although it is possible, we are not going to create spectral response curve for each of the images in the collection. We demonstrated a couple of approaches to retrieve a single image from the collection to produce a spectral response curve. This activity builds on the activity 6 with the aim of identifying major surface types and produce their spectral response curves. It is assumed that you are able to retrieve an image collection from the Earth Engine catalog and filter the collection to the requirements of your project. The region of interest created in Activity 6 is used.


## Learning Outcomes
At the end of this activity, you should be able to:

- Visualize an image collection
- Create feature collections
- Clip an image
- Produce and interpret spectral response curves
