# Activity 2: Understanding the Earth Engine User Interface
## Introduction
This activity assumes that you have a Google Earth Engine account that is running OK. 
The Google Earth Engine User Interface is supported by JavaScript programming language, making it possible to explore a web-based Code Editor without any installation.
The Code Editor, through the JavaScript Application Programming Inteface (API), provide additional functionality to display results on a map, manage scripts, access reference documentation, manage tasks, and more. The Code Editor also makes it possible to share your code with other users, making it easy for others to replicate your methods while promoting collaboration and communication of project results. A detailed description of the Earth Engine User Interface is given in the figure below. <br>
