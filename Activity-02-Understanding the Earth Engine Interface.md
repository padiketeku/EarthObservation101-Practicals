# Activity 2: Understanding the Earth Engine User Interface
## Introduction
This activity assumes that you have a Google Earth Engine account that is running OK. 
The Google Earth Engine User Interface is supported by JavaScript programming language, making it possible to explore a web-based Code Editor without any installation.
The Code Editor, through the JavaScript Application Programming Inteface (API), provide additional functionality to display results on a map, manage scripts, access reference documentation, manage tasks, and more. The Code Editor also makes it possible to share your code with other users, making it easy for others to replicate your methods while promoting collaboration and communication of project results. 

## Learning Outcomes
• Familiarity with the Earth Engine Code Editor.
• Familiarity with the JavaScript syntax.
• Ability to use the Earth Engine API functions from the Code Editor

## The Earth Engine Interface
Fig.1 shows the Earth Engine User Interface; familiarise yourself with the various panes and widgets. The features are thoroughly covered in the book.

### The Code Editor
The Code Editor is an integrated development environment for the Earth Engine JavaScript API. It offers an easy way to type, debug, run, and manage code. Once you have followed Google’s documentation on registering for an Earth Engine account, you should follow the documentation to open the Code Editor. The Code Editor allows you to type JavaScript code and execute it. When first learning a new language and getting used to a new programming environment, it is customary to make a program to display the words “Hello World.” This is a fun way to start coding that shows you how to give input to the program and how to execute it. The Code Editor also shows where the program displays the output. Doing this in JavaScript is quite simple. 
Copy the following code snippet into the Code Editor. 

```JavaScript
print ('Hello World')
```
The above line of code uses the JavaScript print function to command the computer to print “Hello World”. Once you enter the code, click `Run`. The output will be displayed to the upper right-hand pane under the **`Console`** tab (Fig. 2). Throughout this book, a code will appear distinctively, as shown above. Feel free to copy, paste, and run a code in the Code Editor.

Once you are satisfied with your code, you may want to save it. To do this, click the Save button (Figure 1.4). It is always important to save your script to be sure you have it on the cloud.

On your first use of the Code Editor you might be prompted to create a home folder. This is a cloud-based folder where all your scripts will be saved. Remember to read the note accompanying the prompt, as you are reminded that you cannot change the folder's name once it is created. Your Google Account username is probably the most ideal name to select for the home folder (Figure 1.5).

Once you click “Continue” to create your home folder, you are prompted to create a new repository. A repository will contain your script files, which you can share with others. You can create a repository for a different project, so it is possible to have many repositories. Create your first repository and name this “IRS-class” (Figure 1.6). Make sure you click “CREATE” to complete this step.

Now that you have a repository created, you can save your first JavaScript code i.e., print (‘Hello World’) to the repository “IRS_class”. Enter the name “print_hello_world” and click OK (Figure 1.7).

The script then becomes available in the script manager panel. Given the script is saved in the cloud, you can always access this online regardless of your geographic location. This is the end of the activity 2, you should now be confident to create, run and save scripts in the Code Editor.
