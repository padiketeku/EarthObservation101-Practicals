# Activity 11 Classification Accuracy Assessment
Activity 11 expands on the Activity 10, Image Classification. This activity evaluates the performance of the classifier for 'unseen'data using error matrix.
Accuracy metrics, such as producer's accuracy, consumer's accuracy, overall accuracy, kappa, and F1-score are computed and explained.

## Introduction
Image classification is conducted by using training data point to teach the model. However, the performance of the model must be measured to assess its usability.This is done by allowing the model to predict a set of data that is unknown to the model





## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this activity, you should be able to:

- Validate a classification model using error matrix
- Interpret accuracy metrics
- Calculate spatial coverage of cover classes
