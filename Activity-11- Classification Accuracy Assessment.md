# Activity 11 Classification Accuracy Assessment

Activity 11 expands on the Activity 10, Image Classification. This activity evaluates the performance of the classifier for an 'unseen' data using error matrix.
Accuracy metrics, such as producer's accuracy, consumer's accuracy, overall accuracy, kappa, and F1-score are computed and explained.

## Introduction

Image classification is conducted by using training data point to teach the model. However, the performance of the model must be measured to assess its usability. This is done by allowing the model to predict a set of data that is unknown to the model. The observed labels and the predicted labels can then be compared in a 2D matrix, referred to as confusion matrix, to determine the performance of the model. 





## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this activity, you should be able to:

- Validate a classification model using error matrix
- Interpret accuracy metrics
- Calculate spatial coverage of cover classes



## Activity Begins


### Task
1, Validate the CART classification in Activity 10, producing the following metrics to describe the accuracy of the model:

a, producer's accuracy <br>
b, consumer's accuracy <br>
c, overall accuracy <br>
d, kappa <br>
e, F1-score <br>

2, Compute the spatial coverage of cleared land
